            Our Job Portal is designed to make job searching simple, fast, and effective.
            Whether you are a fresher or an experienced professional, you can discover
            thousands of job opportunities tailored to your skills and interests.

            Recruiters can register, create a company profile, post jobs, review applicants,
            and accept or reject candidates directly from their dashboard. Candidates can
            apply, track applications, and update their profiles effortlessly, while admins
            keep platform control available as an optional higher-privilege role.
